This is the punch list of things I need to do for the R25 proposal that don't
relate to actual writing of the proposal.

## Administrative shell
  * ~~Budget~~
  * ~~Summary~~
  * ~~Biosketch~~
  * ~~Narrative~~
  * ~~Word file~~
  * ~~Title~~


## Letters of support/committment
  * Vince Young
  * Harry Mobley
  * Mary O'Riordan
  * Jeff DeWitt/Jim Cavalcoli
  * CRLT / other evaluators
  * Tracy Teal
  * Julie Segre
  * Eric Pamer
  * Gary Huffnagle
  * ASM


## Evaluation plan
  * ~~Check with other evaluators in A2~~
  * Find papers on doing evaluations with auto-tutorial content
