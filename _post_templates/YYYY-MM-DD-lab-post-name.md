This post template is geared towards describing experiments you've been working
on in the lab. Copy this file into your _posts directory and rename it using the formating
indicated in the file name. Also, change the title in the YAML header above
as well as the date.

Next you will need to craft an <80 word abstract for your blog post that is the
first paragraph of the post. This will show up on the index page and will be
useful for quickly seeing what you discuss in this posting. If you look at the
first page of the blog, you'll quickly see what these paragraphs are.

Each blog post should concern itself with a single goal and at a minimum should
have the following headings:

### Objective



### Experiment design



### Results



### Discussion



### What's next
